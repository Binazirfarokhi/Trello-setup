How to setup
What is Trello? 
Is a management tool for all team members to follow their progress for their projct. 
we need to organize the people in the trello :
1. Product backlog : all the tasks you need to do in this project / the list should be based on high periority
2. sprint backlog : it is a iteration , every week we need to have a meeting together. which card from product backlog will be added here.IF they are two desgirs working on one task we should duplicate that card and assign it ot them / the point is each person can have only one card
4. in progress : in this cards you can add google drive or google docs to share with othera. in the power-ups on the side bar.
5. review : you can use @board and ask everyone to review all codes.
6. done : each sprint is one weeek. all tasks should be done before the next meeting
   these are the boards you need to create as a PM.
